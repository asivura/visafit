            "reasoning": "The CV mentions that Robert Smith reviewed and judged technical papers for a mid-tier tech conference. While this demonstrates participation in judging the work of others, the conference is described as mid-tier, which may not fully meet the high standards typically required for O-1A visa qualification. Therefore, the rating is 'low'."

            "reasoning": "The CV explicitly states that Robert Smith commanded a high salary in the top 10% of the industry standard for software consultants, supported by pay statements and contract details. This clearly meets the criterion for high remuneration, warranting a 'high' rating."
