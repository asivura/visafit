            "reasoning": "The CV includes a scholarly article authored by Paul Stirling, published in the Journal of Hospitality Management. This satisfies the criterion for authorship of scholarly articles in the field. The rating is 'medium' because while the publication is relevant, there is only one article listed, and additional publications would strengthen the case."
