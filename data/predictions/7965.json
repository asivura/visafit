            "reference": "Received the \"Outstanding Service Award\" from the California Clerk Association in 2018 for excellence in administrative support.",
            "reasoning": "The CV mentions an award received from the California Clerk Association, which is a recognized professional association. However, the award is for administrative support rather than a specific field of endeavor, and there is no information on the criteria used to grant the award or its national or international significance. Therefore, the rating is low."

            "reasoning": "The CV mentions being featured in a newspaper for innovative methods in managing court administrative tasks. While this is a form of media coverage, it is not clear if \"City Times\" is a major media outlet or if the coverage was substantial. Therefore, the rating is low."
