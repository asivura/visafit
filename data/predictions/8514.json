            "reference": "Member of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), which requires outstanding achievements in the field of science education",
            "reasoning": "The CV indicates membership in the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), which requires outstanding achievements in the field of science education. This aligns with the criterion's requirement for membership in associations that require outstanding achievements as judged by recognized experts. However, the CV does not provide detailed information about the selection process or the level of recognition within the association, so a medium rating is assigned."
