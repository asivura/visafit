You are tasked with reformatting and improving a poorly formatted CV (Curriculum Vitae). Your goal
is to transform the input CV into a well-written, professional CV using markdown format.

Here is the poorly formatted CV text:

<cv_text>
{CV_TEXT}
</cv_text>

Follow these steps to reformat and improve the CV:

1. Analyze the input CV text and identify the following sections (if present):
- Personal Information (name, contact details)
- Professional Summary or Objective
- Work Experience
- Education
- Skills
- Achievements or Awards
- Any additional sections (e.g., Publications, Volunteer Work, Languages)

2. Restructure the CV content into these standard sections, organizing the information logically and
chronologically where appropriate.

3. Format the CV using markdown, following these guidelines:
- Use a single #for the name at the top of the CV
- Use ## for main section headings
- Use ### for subsection headings (e.g., job titles or degree names)
- Use bullet points (-) for listing items such as responsibilities, achievements, or skills
- Use **bold** for emphasis on important information like job titles or degree names
- Use *italics* for dates or other secondary information
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections if needed

4. Ensure the formatting is consistent throughout the document.


Output the reformatted and improved CV in markdown format, enclosed within <markdown_cv> tags. Do
not include any explanations or comments outside of these tags.

effectively showcases the individual's qualifications and experience.
