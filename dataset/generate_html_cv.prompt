You are tasked with converting a CV from markdown format into a creative and unique HTML format.
The goal is to create an HTML output that is both visually appealing and easy to read, while also
being suitable for conversion into a good-looking PDF file.

Here is the CV text in markdown format:

<cv_markdown>
{CV_TEXT}
</cv_markdown>

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Parse the markdown content, identifying different sections such as headers, subheaders, lists,
and paragraphs.

2. Create a unique HTML structure that doesn't simply mimic the markdown formatting. Consider using
modern HTML5 semantic tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;
to organize the content.

3. Design a creative layout that enhances readability. This could include:
- Using a grid or flexbox layout
- Implementing a sidebar for certain information
- Creating a multi-column layout for appropriate sections

4. Apply CSS styling to make the CV visually appealing. Consider:
- Using a unique color scheme that's professional yet distinctive
- Implementing custom fonts that are easily readable
- Using creative ways to highlight important information (e.g., skill levels, achievements)

5. Ensure the design is clean and easy to read. Use appropriate spacing, font sizes, and contrast to
improve readability.

6. Keep in mind that the HTML should be easily convertible to a PDF. Avoid designs that might not
translate well to a static format.

7. Include print-specific CSS to ensure the PDF version looks good. This might include:
- Adjusting margins for printing
- Ensuring all content fits well on standard paper sizes
- Using print-friendly colors

8. Implement microdata or schema.org vocabularies to enhance the semantic structure of the CV, which
can be beneficial for parsing by automated systems.

Output your complete HTML (including CSS) inside &lt;html&gt; tags. Ensure that all necessary
styling is included within a &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML document.

Remember, the key is to create something unique and creative while maintaining professionalism and
readability. Your design should stand out from typical CV templates while still effectively
presenting the information.

You MUST NOT include ```html, ```css, or any other code block in your response. Only include the generated HTML.
